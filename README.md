# Bank-Data-Analysis-with-K-means-Clustering

Analysis report:

1.	normolize the dataset, remove the NA.
2.	convert the factor to number for k-means implement 
3.	check and deal with outliers.
4.	choose the number of clusters we need 
5.	check the clusters, size, means, vectors, sum of squares
6.	plot the correlation 
7.	check centers, clusters 

Actually, in this case, we use K-means algorithm to classify group. 
k-means is sensitive to outliers, but in this case, do not have outliers, it is a good way to do data mining.
The k value here as I mentioned before, it is supposed to be 2 according to the graph which plotted 9 iterations.

Every group has similar features, as the result shows:
people who is 62 years old, their income higher, and the number of the children they have also a little bit more than other generation. 
The 42 age generation they have less children. The features are below with size.

As we can see, For the business men, they can make decision depend on size of group and the all kinds of features that this group have and make objective strategy more effectively.
